**Properties of hash function**

- If h(x)=h(y), then x and y might be equal. But if h(x) <> h(y), h and y are definitely not equal
- h(x) should be deterministic. It must always produce the same result
- Hash collision is when two objects x and y have the same hash value i.e h(x)=h(y). We should try to minimize hash collisions
